Hello World

Here is the source code of my website located at 
http://bookshomes.org where i tried to create things to 
help readers of books reading well using features as audio

IMPORTANT: 
The first and only purpose is to make a largest
repository of audio books easier to listen and well done.

That said, I'm keep working on approaches that will help me
personalizing user experiment with the website
